      <h2>About Drew</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Drew Hartwig and I am a fourth year student at the University of Iowa. A little bit about me incluides
        growing up and being born in Iowa City. It has been my home since day one and I look to finish my time here strong 
        as I graduate this spring in May.

      <p>
       Throughout my semesters at the University of Iowa, I have taken plenty of courses beneficial to my degrees, along with
       general education courses that allowed me to learn outside of my main studies. Below are my favorite courses
       listed each year I have studied at the Universtity of Iowa.
